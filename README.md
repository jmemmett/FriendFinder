Overview

This full-stack Friend-Finder application will take in results from a set of survey questions answered by the user, and will then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Express is used to handle the routing.

The survey has 10 questions of your choosing.

Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 (based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question).

After submitting the survey, the user will be presented with a friend suggestion from within an array of 10 characters that is stored inside the friend.js file.
